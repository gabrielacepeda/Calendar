## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB

For this prohect, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB, I created this monthly calendar app. It displays what day it is and you can input and delete events.

## Optimizations
I'm currently working on the add and delete event buttons functionality. It will not input the event in the corresponding date.

## Lessons Learned:
Relying on back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Express and MongoDB, to make an app functional was new to me.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `npm run calendar`
2. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
